MIS661 DB3 Classification Problem

This project is looking at the load_wine data set and is attempting to classify the wines based on their features.

After loading the libraries and dataset, I explored the data to see if there were any characteristics or correlations that stood out.

Finally, I split the data into a training set and test set and ran a logistic regression of one verses the rest.
